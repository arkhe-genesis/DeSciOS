φ as Design Principle in Avalon
Document ID: AVALON-PHI-DESIGN-001
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ARCHITECTURAL POLICY
Classification: Non-physical / Aesthetic
1. The Principle
The golden ratio φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618 is used in Avalon as a design principle — an organizing aesthetic that shapes default choices, proportions, and naming conventions. It is not a physical law, not a thermodynamic attractor, and not an emergent property of the TUT bound.
2. Where φ Appears
2.1 Geometric Defaults
Honeycomb cell aspect ratio: default 1:φ
Network layout spacing: default grid step = φ (in arbitrary units)
Visualization proportions: default figure aspect = φ:1
2.2 Parameter Defaults
Default coupling ratio in oscillator networks: J₂/J₁ = 1/φ
Default damping-to-driving ratio: γ/ω = 1/φ²
Default confidence threshold for anomaly detection: 1/φ ≈ 0.618
2.3 Versioning and Naming
Major version increments follow Fibonacci sequence (v1, v2, v3, v5, v8...)
Internal codenames use Greek letters in φ-proportioned intervals
3. Where φ Does NOT Appear
3.1 Physical Bounds
The TUT bound ε² ≥ 1/⟨tanh(Σ/2)⟩ − 1 does not converge to 1/φ for any physically preferred reason.
If a simulation produces ε² ≈ 1/φ, that is a coincidence or a deliberately tuned result, not an emergent law.
3.2 Thermodynamic Optimization
There is no principle of "maximum φ-efficiency" in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.
The optimal protocol for a given process minimizes ε², regardless of whether the minimum is near 1/φ.
3.3 Cosmological Selection
The no-boundary proposal in quantum cosmology does not select φ.
Any connection between φ and the Hartle-Hawking state is metaphorical.
4. Operational Rule
When implementing Avalon systems:
Use φ as default when no physical constraint dictates otherwise.
Override φ immediately when physics, engineering, or user requirements demand a different value.
Never claim that φ is "emergent," "optimal," or "selected by" the TUT, DFT, or any physical law.
Document deviations from φ as "engineering optimization," not "physics correction."
5. Example
Python
# CORRECT: φ as default, overridden by physics
aspect_ratio = PHI  # default aesthetic
if thermal_constraint:
    aspect_ratio = compute_optimal_aspect(thermal_params)  # physics wins

# INCORRECT: φ imposed as physical law
aspect_ratio = PHI  # because "the universe prefers it"
6. Connection to TUT
The TUT provides a bound on precision. The design principle φ provides a default. They intersect only when an engineer chooses to set the target precision to 1/φ for aesthetic reasons.
